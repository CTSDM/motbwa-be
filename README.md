# motbwa-be
motbwa - 못봐 in Korean means "Cant' see'. This is the backend for a chat application using websockets with encryption end to end. The application is written in Go.
Users can register and start private chats with other users, or create groups and invite other people to it. For now there is no support to send or receive anything besides text messages.
